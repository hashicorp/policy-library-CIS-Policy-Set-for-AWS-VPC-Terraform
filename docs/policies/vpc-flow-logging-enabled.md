## Description

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow Logs be enabled for packet "Rejects" for VPCs.

This rule is covered by the [vpc-flow-logging-enabled](../../policies/vpc-flow-logging-enabled.sentinel) policy.
